                  <p>
                    While studying at Virginia Tech, eight weeks before graduation, Wendy had her first manic episode. It was then she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I. She graduated and worked in a number of fields until being downsized from corporate America in her early thirties. It was then she plugged in her laptop for good and wrote her first book, a memoir: I'm Not Crazy Just Bipolar.

                    Wendy has written for BP Magazine, Bipolar Disorder for Dummies, 2nd Edition and The Two River Times. She currently blogs for BPHope.com. Her book has been reviewed by Publishers Weekly and National Alliance on Mental Illness’ The Advocate. Wendy is the co-founder of The Red Bank Writers Group and has been interviewed on over thirty radio stations nationwide. She resides in Monmouth County, NJ with her two kitties and fiancé, burning out laptops to stay sane.

                  <p><font style="font-weight:bold">Honora Rose</font></p>
                  <p>
                    Honora is a graduate of Boston University. Upon graduation, she worked in the financial industry for ten years before starting a family. She has a thirteen-year-old son and an eleven-year-old daughter.  Not long after the birth of her second child, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I, rapid cycling. At age thirty-five, Honora’s years of meteoric highs and crushing lows finally had a name and her journey to wellness was born.

                    Honora is the co-founder of The Red Bank Writers Group, voracious reader and skilled editor. Two Bipolar Chicks Guide to Survival: Tips for Living with Bipolar Disorder is her first book with co-author Wendy K. Williamson.

                      <p>I don’t know any psychologists or M.D.s, including myself, who could have written this book by the Two Bipolar Chicks. Over the past nine years I have given trainings in bipolar disorder for over thirty thousand mental health professionals. At every training I have stated that the missing link between the science and treatment of bipolar disorder is . . . the practicalities.</p>
                      <p>My mother had bipolar disorder (BiPD), so I was raised by someone with BiPD, and one of my daughters has BiPD, so I raised someone with BiPD. If this book was available, it would have made life 1,000% better for my mother, daughter, and myself. I have written five international books, including one best seller. But to be honest, I don’t enjoy writing books. It’s just something I felt led to do. I can’t tell you how ecstatic I am that Wendy K. Williamson, BiPD and Honora A. Rose, BiPD have written this book.. </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="item">
                    <div class="serv_entry text_left">
                      <p>The Two Bipolar Chicks have asked me to write about scientific phenomena, so I am going to give you the most significant phenomenological information I have found thus far, backed up with brain scan activity and latest research on executive functions.</p>
                      <p> The most noted discovery that I have found in people with BiPD is the loss of executive function during mania. That would be the loss of insight, foresight, hindsight, and lack of ability to “see” the consequences of their actions. My best phrase for this is that they are not “seeing themselves.” a mere intellectual understanding of the consequences is not real without vision. When a person is manic, they may be thinking six times faster than you. They may get impatient with you for talking so slowly. They are brilliant. Don’t argue with them: they will win. But they lack the ability to “see” the consequences of their actions, or the context of the situation. The prefrontal lobe is that part of us that enables us to see ourselves. No other mammal on earth has this ability.</p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="item">
                    <div class="serv_entry text_left">
                      <p>During mania there is a flood of activity in the prefrontal lobe. Racing thoughts knock out the ability to see the bigger picture of things with overwhelming details. Then after the mania, there is a distinct lack of activity in the prefrontal lobe for up to six to eight weeks afterward. This is diagnosed as “lack of insight” in most analyses, but a better term would be a temporary lack of executive functions.</p>
                      <p>The prefrontal lobe executive functions are subtle. It is the last thing that develops in the brain and it is the first thing to go. When you lose it, you don’t know you lost it. I have never heard of anyone saying to their therapist, “you know, I think I lost my prefrontal lobe in that last manic episode, because I am not seeing the big picture of things, and I have no insight, foresight, or hindsight.” Because . . . if they could say that, their prefrontal lobe would be working! (you can see more on this at my free one and a half hour seminar at: bipolarlight.com or by searching “midwestpictures” on YouTube.) </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="item">
                    <div class="serv_entry text_left">
                      <p>Another important thing about BiPD is how it affects relationships. When our prefrontal lobe is online, we “see” what we are thinking and decide whether we are going to say it or not. So, you might think your boss or your spouse is a jerk, but after you weigh it out, you may decide not to say it for the sake of the relationship. When a person is manic, the brain is directly connected to the tongue. There is a lack prefrontal lobe filtering things out. We all have private thoughts, but when manic, whatever we are thinking may roll off the tip of our tongues. The person we are saying these things to may take it personally. again, this phenomenon is directly related to lack of executive function in the prefrontal lobe, as well as job loss for “insubordination.”</p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="item">
                    <div class="serv_entry text_left">
                      <p>
                        When the prefrontal lobe goes out like a light bulb, a person may run up their credit cards or have unprotected sex without envisioning the consequences. We know the elderly often need help with taking their medication. This, again, relates to the lack of prefrontal lobe online. The same with bipolar (temporarily) and the authors have brilliant solutions. The Two Bipolar Chicks have nailed the most important and most successful aspect of battling BiPD. . . ensuring you take your meds.

                        When the lobe goes off line, what’s the next best thing to a lobe? Rules. Procedures. Children have no lobe. They need rules, no matter how brilliant they are. They need rules like “Don’t walk down dark alleys.” “Don’t get in a car with a stranger.” an adult without a functioning prefrontal lobe is like a brilliant kid.
